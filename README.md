Colony enables business decision makers the ability to optimize labor costs by infusing public data into a mobile team managing app.  Colony optimizes labor spending by using consumer spending data, recurring revenue information, mixed with personalized business labor costs in order to justify increasing or decreasing labor spending. 

## Implementation
